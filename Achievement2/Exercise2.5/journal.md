# Exercise 2.5: Django MVT Revisited

## Learning Goals
- Add images to the model and display them on the frontend of your application
- Create complex views with access to the model
- Display records with views and templates

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words, explain Django static files and how Django handles them.
    Static files are developer made files used to effect views and templates. Something like Javascript, CSS, or images. This is something you will load into your template.

2. Look up the following two Django packages on Django’s official documentation and/or other trusted sources. Write a brief description of each.
    - ListView
      - Returns a list of objects
    - DetailsView
      - Returns aspects of an object

3. You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 2! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? You can use these notes to guide your next mentor call. 
    I can tell that I am still getting comfortable with the Django way. The basics of what is happening are feeling clear but its organization is not quite in my head yet.
