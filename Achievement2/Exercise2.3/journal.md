# Exercise 2.3: Django Models

## Learning Goals
- Discuss Django models, the “M” part of Django’s MVT architecture
- Create apps and models representing different parts of your web application 
- Write and run automated tests

## Reflection Questions
1. Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are.
    Models are where you define the class and the format of each app or section of the whole project. This is allows for organizing the classes and then the future objects into a clear place so that now when the objects are created you know where to build and change their parameters.


2. In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project. You can take an example project to explain your answer.
    Writing test cases from the beginning of the process is a clean way to make sure you are covering every part of your code. To write a large section of a project, for example 6 apps, then move on to something else. It would be very easy to make mistakes and miss something if you went back later to write the test cases. Beyond best practice habits testing all aspects of code help when you are having errors so that you can go back and find where the problems are.
