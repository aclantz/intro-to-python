# Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django

## Learning Goals
- Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC
- Summarize Django’s benefits and drawbacks 
- Install and get started with Django

## Reflection Questions
1. Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?
    The advantages of using Django are its scalability, quick development process, security, user integration, and range of plug ins available. The disadvantages is it has a strict framework to work within and is designed to be a framework working with a database if you don't plan on using a database then it would get in your way. 


2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?
    The template architecture allows for more scaling by keeping a looser connection between the Model and the template.


3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
  - What do you want to learn about Django? 
      Get a better grasp of MVT, and the language of another framework.

  - What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
      More experience and practice

  - Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
      Potentially a backend project with my brother focused on tennis brackets.
