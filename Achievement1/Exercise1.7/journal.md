# Exercise 1.7: Finalizing Your Python Program
## Learning Goals
- Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper
- Build your final command-line Recipe application

## Reflection Questions

1. What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?
    A ORM is a tool that helps to manage sql queries and apply OOP logic to the sql query format. This allows you to use objects and classes to organize your code and queries. I found this a much easier way to work with a database.

2. By this point, you’ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What’s something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what’s something about your app that you would change or improve?
    I feel proud of my app, I can think to where I was a year ago on my coding journey and all the directions would of overwhelmed me. Now even if I am not sure of the exact answer to what needs to be done I feel confident enough to try and just build something first and then I can clean from there. That is what I am most proud of my own growth. Something I would improve in the app would maybe be just the layout, I feel like I could have played with the CLI layout and made the text more exciting.


3. Imagine you’re at a job interview. You’re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question.
    I made a recipe app with python, it involved connecting to a SQL database and querying the database with an ORM, we used sqlalchemy. The application was a backend project where I built logic to support creating, editing, viewing, and deleting recipe data. 
 
4. You’ve finished Achievement 1! Before moving on to Achievement 2, take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far: 
    - What went well during this Achievement? 
        My skills in thinking through logic, and building drafts.

    - What’s something you’re proud of? 
        I am proud of the whole application and how I went about creating it.

    - What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement? 
        The most challenging part at the beginning was shifting syntax from JS and by the end the most difficult part was getting mysqlclient to work, I ended up giving up and using pymysql.

    - Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Python skills?
        Yes, I feel like I have a much better idea of how python works and can see how with this base experience I would be set up to do more.

    - What’s something you want to keep in mind to help you do your best in Achievement 2?
        Just build and try even when you feel confused. It’s ok to get it wrong.
