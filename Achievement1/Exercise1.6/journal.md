# Exercise 1.6: Connecting to Databases in Python

## Learning Goals
- Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

## Reflection Questions

1. What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?
		Databases are external places to keep data. This is convent because trying tot store data locally or within an application takes up valuable space and and can become cumbersome quickly.

2. List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:
    INT - An integer, number value with no decimal
    FLOAT - An integer, number value WITH decimal values
    VARCHAR() - A sequence of characters, string

3. In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?
		If the DB you were building was small or consisting of simple data. For example if you were just collecting email address from users.


4. Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?
		Python feels more dev friendly or more easily accessible. In a lot of ways it feels like the exact same just a different syntax. I think the syntax just feels easier. I could see how they both have advantages.

5. Now that youâ€™re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?
		I can see how python would be useful in building backend frameworks but I do not see how it could work as a front end language. It would be harder to access the DOM or react to an existing file.
